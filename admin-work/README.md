# Admin Work

My personal bash scripts to admin my work (at my job and when working on my personal projects too)

### rest-eyes.sh

After start working I run this script so in 30 minutes it will make a sound and let me know I need to rest my eyes. Then I press enter and it does the same in 5 minutes to let me know I'm ready to go back to work in front of my screen. Then the cycle starts again. Kind of a Pomodoro alarm but for my eyes :eyes:

I can enter "stop" to stop the script after each alarm sound.

### check.sh

When using Slack, one day it started closing itself without me noticing. I implemented this script to check every 5 seconds if Slack was open or not, and if it was closed, make an alerting sound so I could open it again.

I solved the problem with Slack so I don't use this script anymore, but I'm saving it because it can be useful in the future.
